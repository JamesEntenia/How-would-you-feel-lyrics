        <p id="tribute-info"><br>You are the one girl<br/>
            And you know that it's true<br>
            I'm feeling younger<br>
            Every time that I'm alone with you<br><br>
            We were sitting in a parked car<br>
            Stealing kisses in the front yard<br>
            We got questions we should not ask but<br><br>
            How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?<br>
            It's just something that I want to do<br>
            I'll be taking my time, spending my life<br>
            Falling deeper in love with you<br>
            So tell me that you love me too<br><br>
            In the summer, as the lilacs bloom<br>
            Love flows deeper than the river<br>
            Every moment that I spend with you<br>
            We were sat upon our best friend's roof<br>
            I had both of my arms round you<br>
            Watching the sunrise replace the moon<br><br>
            How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?<br>
            It's just something that I want to do<br>
            I'll be taking my time, spending my life<br>
            Falling deeper in love with you<br>
            So tell me that you love me too<br><br>
            We were sitting in a parked car<br>
            Stealing kisses in the front yard<br>
            We got questions we shouldn not ask<br><br>
            How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?<br>
            It's just something that I want to do<br>
            I'll be taking my time, spending my life<br>
            Falling deeper in love with you<br>
            So tell me that you love me too<br>
            Tell me that you love me too<br>
            Tell me that you love me too</p>
